# rudy-discord-bot
rudy right now, is a basic discord bot created using discord.py API. To set it up

First install all the dependencies

```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
You are good to go! Just follow the comments in main.py

## IMPORTANT 
A part of this code was taken from the *Tech with Tim* and *ExceedCodes* channel because I was still learning how to use discord.py API.
